## Customization

The customization of this appication is based on the JSON data, which is located in the [public folder](https://github.com/acodeidea/acodeidea.github.io/tree/master/public). 
The [main_data.json](https://github.com/acodeidea/acodeidea.github.io/blob/master/public/main_data.json) file has the Expense Claim, Teams Finder, and Spinner data, which is used in the home page for navigation.

<b>Expense Claim:</b>
If you want to add new expense categories or modifying the existing categories, you can directly edit into this [expense_static_data.json](https://github.com/acodeidea/acodeidea.github.io/blob/master/public/expense_static_data.json) file.

<b>Teams Finder & Spinner:</b>
Like the expense claim, you're able to edit the teams list in the [teams_list.json](https://github.com/acodeidea/acodeidea.github.io/blob/master/public/teams_list.json) file.

Note: Only the active data is visible for the both Teams Finder and Spinner.
